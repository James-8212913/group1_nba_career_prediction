# Experiment Background

One of the challenges for rising NBA stars is where to focus their efforts on skills that should be developed. Related to this is the the investment in different players based on different game statistics for managers and coaches. This experiment is seeking to better understand the variables that contribute as key markers to career success. Career success is defined as players that will be kept on the roster for more than 5 years.

## Business Objectives

An understanding for player managers and players themselves of which key stats will lead to career longevity. It could also assist in directing time and effort both in recruiting for managers and where players should focus efforts in skill development.

## Hypothesis

It is possible to model career performance based on key statistics that are already gathers by the different basketball leagues.

## Experiment Objectives

Determine which features are correlated with a career of 5 years or longer then develop a model based on the different features. It will be a classification model.

# Experiment Details

The initial model will be developed using xgBoost as a classification model. Features will be added in one at a time to better understand and develop a level of explainability to the model thereby assisting with the interpretation for both players and managers.

## Data Preparation

The Data was split into a train and test set. There were 8000 entries in the training Data set and these were further broken down into a
